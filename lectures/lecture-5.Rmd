## Covariance and Correlation

Strength of a linear association between 2 random variables can be formalised into the concept of **correlation**.

What can result in correlation of A and B?

- Causal relationship (A ==> B)
- Another factor affects both (C ==> A  and  C ==> B)
- Chance

Things happening by chance may show up more often when you have a small sample size.

<br>

To get a quantitative assessment of correlation, we first need to calculate a quantity called **covariance**.

Covariance that is negative = negative correlation (\\)). Covariance that is positive = positive correlation (/)

By scaling covariance by the variance of X and Ym we get **Pearson's correlation coefficient**.

<br>

Rejecting the null hypothesis!

We need to run a t-test for the estimator of both X and Y to see if they are normally distributed. To get confidence interval.

There are other tests/things to do for non-normal or small sample size data.

<br>

Pearson's *r* ==> linear relationship

Spearman's rho ==> monotonic relationship

Kendall's tau ==> similar to Spearman, but more robust to outliers and small sample sizes

<br>

If you have a lot of data, you are almost guaranteed to have a low *p*-value. Just keep that in mind when making your conclusions.

If you have strong outliers, you might want to use Kendall's tau.

#### Correlation for circular data

Circular data: data measured on a circular scale. (e.g., angles, wind direction, time of day, day or year, which has a *cyclic* nature).

AKA directional or angular data.

Often visualised in polar coordinates (like a graph around a point)

It's important that we have special tests for circular data, because regular linear analysis might not catch patterns that exist.

<br>

Circular vs. linear variables: makes sense for my brain. A single circle graph.

Circular vs. circular variables: difficult for me to visualise.

<br>

There are other circular statistics, too.

**Circular mean**. TK

**Circular variance** and circular standard deviation. E.g., is wind direction more variable in this month than that month?
